            Hello! My name is <strong>Sumit Pimpare</strong>. I'm from
            Maharashtra, India and have been living in Pune for the past Seven
            years. And Working as a Software Engineering (React Developer) for 3+
            years. During my time here, I gained valuable experience through
            various entry-level positions, which greatly enhanced my work ethic,
            communication skills, and adaptability.
            <br />
            <br />
            My journey into the world of technology began with a strong passion
            for problem-solving, which led me to pursue the Computer Systems
            Technology program. Despite its challenges, I remained determined
            and forged lasting friendships that supported me throughout this
            demanding program. Throughout my studies at SPPU, I had the
            opportunity to engage in fascinating projects.
            <br />
            <br />
            Working collaboratively within a team towards a shared objective has
            been an incredibly rewarding and unique experience for me. I am
            eager to continue exploring exciting projects in the future, with a
            particular interest in web development and cross-platform mobile
            development.
